# spelling_bee_solver
Program that solves the NYT anagram game Spelling Bee!

Have you ever been playing spelling bee in an open tab all day, but it's nearly 3 pm -- the puzzle is about to expire and you haven't guessed the pangram!! The Spelling Bee creator is going to judge or something :/ ...unless you use spelling_bee_solver to get all the words and impress friends and loved ones with consistent perfect scores!

## How to run the solver
Clone the repo, and then run the script "make_dict.py" to prepare the dictionary for the game.
Feel free to use your own dicionary! Just update the python script with the name of your other file.
